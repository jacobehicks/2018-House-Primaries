# 2018-House-Primaries

This repository contains replication content for my Emory College of Arts and Sciences Honors Program research, "Candidate Ideology and Electoral Outcomes in the 2018 U.S. House of Representatives Election: Evidence from Primary Elections and Twitter Ideal-Point Data."

For this project I have compiled a unique dataset based on multiple sources, including Catalist, the FEC, [Dr. Pablo Barbera](https://github.com/pablobarbera/twitter_ideology), and original data collection. The full dataset can be found in this repository.
