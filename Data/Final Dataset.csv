Ranked-choice voting, sometimes called “instant run-off voting,” allows voters to choose their candidates in order of preference, by marking candidates as their first, second, third and subsequent choices.  The Democratic primary for Congressional District 2 and the general election for Congressional District 2 did not have majority winners on election night (the first-choice count) and went into ranked-choice voting rounds. The results shown above represent the first-choice totals.  For the Democratic primary, the final-round vote totals were: Jared Golden, 23,611 (54.32%) and  Lucas St. Clair, 19,853 (45.68%).
